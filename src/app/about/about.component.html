    <h1 class="lg-text">About Us</h1>
    <p class="image-aboutus-para">The Food and Beverage (F&B) industry includes all companies involved in producing,
        processing, packaging, transporting, and distributing edible goods - from the farm (or factory) to the fork. The
        F&B industry is one of the world's largest industries with regards to both revenue and employment.</p>

            <!-- Post Content -->
            <p class="lead" data-aos="slide-up">Like all companies, F&B companies have an obligation to ensure that
                children's rights are respected and supported throughout their business practices, and many are indeed
                doing so. F&B companies also have a unique opportunity to proactively support children's rights.</p>
            <p data-aos="slide-up"><span class="subHead">Stage 1</span> Production of 'inputs'. As this stage consists
                mainly of agricultural
                activities, children can be involved in child labour or human trafficking. It is also during this stage
                that companies can have a significant impact on the environment and on communities - for example, on
                water and sanitation as well as forced displacement of communities. Consequently, a child's right to
                development, education, health and recreation can be affected directly.</p>
            <p data-aos="slide-up"><span class="subHead">Stage 2</span> Processing and manufacturing. During this
                stage, companies influence the
                type of food products that will be available, and the way they will be presented. A child's right to
                health can be violated in two ways: the use of unhealthy ingredients added to products, and the
                pollution generated by the processes. Unethical marketing practices targeted at children are also found
                during this stage, impacting children’s right to information.</p>
            <p data-aos="slide-up"><span class="subHead">Stage 3</span> Consumption and consumerism. It is during this
                stage that children actually
                consume the goods that were produced by the industry. Their right to health and development can
                therefore be directly impacted.</p>
